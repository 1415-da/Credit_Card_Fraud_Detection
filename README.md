# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Jupyter Notebook Analysis)

A comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project for detecting credit card fraud, performed entirely in a Jupyter Notebook. This project leverages public datasets and modern data science tools to explore, visualize, and model fraudulent transactions.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of credit card transactions
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Building and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection
- Visualizing results and model performance

All work is conducted within a single Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

---

## 🚀 Features

- In-depth data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing and feature selection
- Training and evaluation of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations: confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance
- Clear documentation and code comments
